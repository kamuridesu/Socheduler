# Project Idea: Social Media Scheduler

The goal of this project is to build a web-based social media scheduler that allows users to schedule posts on various social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

Here are some features and requirements for the project:

    Users should be able to sign up for an account and log in to the application.
    Once logged in, users should be able to connect their social media accounts to the application.
    Users should be able to create new posts, edit existing posts, and delete posts.
    Users should be able to schedule posts for a specific date and time in the future.
    The application should use Celery to queue scheduled posts and automatically publish them at the scheduled time.
    Users should be able to view their scheduled posts and see when they are scheduled to be published.
    The application should also provide some basic analytics for each post, such as the number of likes, comments, and shares.

To implement this project, you'll need to use Django and DRF to build the web application and API, and Celery to handle the scheduling and publishing of posts.

You can use third-party packages such as Django-allauth for user authentication, django-crispy-forms for creating forms, and django-celery-beat for scheduling tasks.

This project is a great opportunity to demonstrate your skills in building a full-stack web application using Django, DRF, and Celery, and to showcase your ability to integrate with third-party APIs and services.
